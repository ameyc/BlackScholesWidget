## BlackScholes Widget

Based on [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Additionally the [demo notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/oscar6echo/BlackScholesWidget/blob/master/demo_blackscholes_widget.ipynb) contains some javascript to
    + hide the code cells
    + (re)initialize the notebook (ie restart kernel then run all cells)
so as the make the notebook (almost) appear as a webapp.
